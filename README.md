# Mobile App Development .NET MAUI TaskerApp with Database
Repurposing my a task tracking application using .NET MAUI with database integration to save all tasks and categories and any other feature I can add to make it more user friendly.

The application will need to contain these functionalities listed:<br>
• SQL integration<br>
• Ability to create tasks<br>
• Tasks will need to be updated and deleted<br>
• These should be categorized and colour coded<br>
• Ability to add additional categories<br>
• Task progression based on tasks completed vs total tasks<br>
• Visual representation of completed tasks (strike out, tick box)<br>
