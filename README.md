# Mobile App Development .NET MAUI TaskerApp
Repurposing my a task tracking application using .NET MAUI with database integration to save all tasks and categories and any other feature I can add to make it more user friendly.

The application will need to contain these functionalities listed:
• SQL integration<br>
• Ability to create tasks
• Tasks will need to be updated and deleted
• These should be categorized and colour coded
• Ability to add additional categories
• Task progression based on tasks completed vs total tasks
• Visual representation of completed tasks (strike out, tick box)
